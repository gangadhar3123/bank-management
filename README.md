This is a simple banking system implemented in Python, providing basic functionalities such as creating an account, logging in, depositing, withdrawing, checking balance, and viewing mini statements. The system consists of two classes: Account and BankManagement. The Account class represents a bank account with attributes such as username, password, and balance. The BankManagement class manages the banking system, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and perform various banking operations. The system uses a dictionary to store accounts, with usernames as keys and corresponding Account objects as values. The program runs in an infinite loop, presenting users with a menu to choose from various options, including creating an account, logging in, and exiting the system. Once logged in, users can perform deposit, withdrawal, balance check, and mini statement operations. The system validates user input, ensuring that usernames and passwords are correct, and that deposit and withdrawal amounts are valid. Overall, this program demonstrates basic banking system functionalities and provides a simple, text-based interface for users to interact with.
